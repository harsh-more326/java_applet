# java_applet
Excited to share my very first GitHub repository with you all. Just a heads up, I might've missed a few things since I'm still getting the hang of this!

So, here's the deal: nobody's really using Applet anymore, right? But hey, sometimes you still gotta whip up projects on that topic. So, I've put together a few of projects hoping they might come in handy for someone out there.

Feel free to dive in, give feedback, or even toss in your own ideas. Let's make this a fun and helpful space for everyone involved!
